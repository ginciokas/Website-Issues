ATLauncher Website Issue Tracker
================================

This is the issue tracker for the ATLauncher website including the website itself, server list, api and admin panel.

To submit an issue head [here](https://github.com/ATLauncher/Website-Issues/issues) and check for an existing issue before posting a new one. When an issue has been fixed, the issue will be automatically closed. If the issue still occurs then please comment on the issue for it to be reopened.

If you wish to get resolution on your issue a bit quicker, you may contact RyanTheAllmighty on #ATLauncher on EsperNet IRC **AFTER** making an issue here. But please note you may just be told to wait if it's not something immediately fixable or urgent or you may get no response at all.

No code is here as you can see, but it's merely a place to report issues with the website and it's components.
